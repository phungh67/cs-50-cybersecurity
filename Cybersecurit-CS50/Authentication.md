There are several types of additional factors that are commonly used:
- **Knowledge** - requires a specific data that only use knows. It will narrow the suspects to who knows the user well (or followers from social media).
- **Possession** - a device or an object that only user has possession. The most famous example is "fingerprint USB" or "Hard-device MFA". This further cut down the list of potential attackers - who must be able to steal this "object".
- **Inherence** - unique ownership - cannot be replicated.
