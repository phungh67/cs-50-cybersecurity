#data #security 

As in the last lecture about [[Data privacy in sharing|Risk in data sharing]], there are several metrics to determine if the data is at risk. 
The most common way to reinforce the data security is *k-anonymity*.
>[!Define]
>The *k-anonymity* can be achieved if with any values in the disclosed set, there are more than *k* values that return the same result.

The trade off in protecting the data privacy
- Less protect means high risk of exposure but higher data utility.
- More protect means lower chances of being steal but the data utility is not too great.

## Homogeneity attack
Even with *k-anonymity*, the dataset is indistinguishable, but with a same sensitive information, the attackers can exploited this.

## Background knowledge attack
